OBJECTIVE: TO DESIGN A FULLY FUNCTIONAL, BROWSER-BASED ROLE PLAYING GAME UTILIZING GANG OF FOUR (GOF) DESIGN PATTERNS AND RIGOROUS TESTING.

METHOD: THIS PROJECT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY PROFESSIONAL MEANS, WITH THE WHOLE PROCESS FOLLOWING A STRICT TIMELINE AND LAYOUT OF VARYING PHASES. SEE ABOVE.
	EL WILL CREATE, CODE, AND MAINTAIN THE PROJECT. BY THE END OF PHASE ONE, DESIGN, EL WILL ASSEMBLE A TESTING TEAM. THERE WILL BE AT LEAST TWO TESTERS
	EACH FOR THE BLACK AND WHITE PHASES. SEE BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. WHEN PHASE TWO, CODE, BEGINS, EL WILL UTILIZE DAILY GIT COMMITS AND THE PRO-
	JECT WILL BE BACKED UP ON ITS GITHUB PAGE--URL "HTTPS://WWW.GITHUB.COM/THEEELGONZO13/PA13"--WITH CONCISE COMMIT MESSAGES. EL WILL ALSO MAINTAIN A DEV-
	ELOPMENT DIARY THROUGH THE GITHUB PROJECT PAGE TO DOCUMENT THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, AND THIS DIARY WILL FOLLOW LESS STRICT PROTOCOL.

TESTING: THE PROJECT WILL UTILIZE A TWO-STAGE TEST CYCLE. TESTING WILL COMMENCE WITH WHITE BOX TESTING, AND THEN BLACK BOX TESTING WILL FOLLOW. AS STATED ABOVE
	EL WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSEMBLING A TEAM BY THE END OF PHASE ONE TO ASSIST WITH TESTING. FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THE TESTING STAGES, EL WILL
	COMPLETE THE FINALIZING TOUCHES ON THE CODE AND READY IT FOR LAUNCH.
